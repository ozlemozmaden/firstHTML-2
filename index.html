        <p>Hi! Welcome to my first HTML project.</p>

        <h4>About Me</h4> <!--Alt başlık -->
        <p> My name is Özlem. I'm 27 years old. I was born in Izmir on march 1995. </p>
        <p>I was working as a real estate agent, but I realized that this was not the job I wanted. </br>
            My girlfriend works as a developer, so I saw how fun coding is. After doing a little research, I found the
            Patika.dev community. </br>
            I hope that after completing the training and reaching a sufficient level, I will take my place in this
            sector.</p>
